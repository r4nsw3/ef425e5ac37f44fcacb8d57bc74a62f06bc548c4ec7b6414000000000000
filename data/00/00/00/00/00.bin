  |   A malevolent force known only as Lina is devouring data from a        |
  |   vast, interdimensional network of servers overseen by sentient        |
  |   computers called "motes". In desperation, the motes summon heroes     |
  |   from a variety of parallel game worlds to face off against each       |
  |   other in one-on-one combat. The tournament victor has the potential   |
  |   to be awakened as the Blade Stranger - the savior who can vanquish    |
  |   Lina and protect the motes from further harm!                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Developed by Studio Saizensen, Blade Strangers is a hardcore          |
  |   old-school fighting game. The streamlined four-button control         |
  |   scheme makes it easy for beginners to deal out damage from day        |
  |   one...but the intricate combos, counters and specials give            |
  |   tournament-caliber players plenty of opportunities for frame          |
  |   counting, chain construction and hit-box science.                     |
  |                                                                         |
